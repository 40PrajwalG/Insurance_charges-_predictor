# Insurance_charges-_predictor
A Machine Learning project that predicts medical insurance charges based on factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, and region using regression models such as Linear and Logistic Regression  Includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and performance evaluation.


# Insurance Charges Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project aims to predict medical insurance charges based on a person’s age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region. I developed this project to understand the basics of Machine Learning, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

---

## Overview
The dataset contains different personal and lifestyle details that affect insurance charges. Using this data, I applied regression algorithms to predict how much an individual might be charged. The project also includes data analysis and visualization to understand how each factor influences the outcome.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Implementation of regression models  
- Model performance evaluation  
- Prediction for new input data  

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `insurance.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- age – Age of the person  
- sex – Gender (male/female)  
- bmi – Body Mass Index  
- children – Number of dependents  
- smoker – Whether the person is a smoker  
- region – Residential area  
- charges – Medical insurance cost

## Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  

(You can modify this section if you used different models.)

## Results
The trained models were evaluated using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² score. The Random Forest model performed the best among the tested algorithms, providing the most accurate predictions on test data.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

---

## Future Work
- Experiment with more advanced algorithms or neural networks  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy  
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask for web-based prediction
